# grcsdrtest configs and scripts for SDR Testing 

This repository holds working grc, py and scripts that are used on several host platforms.

The files at the higher level generally work on most of my setups. 

If the file is under work be very careful this could be in any state at all, and this repository is mainly being used to move the files around.

* bootable partition of MBP 2010 17 (Ubuntu 14.04 LTS)
* macbook air 2013 13 (mac ports under OS X 10.11.2) 
* USB live USB runs against a cica 2009 home build PC.
